### Stacks and Queues
Stack is a data structure where elements are pushed/popped in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner, where as in the case of queue we do the same in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. A pile of books is a good example of a stack, where as people waiting at a ticket counter are a practical example of a queue. These data structures are very commonly used in computer science for solving a lot of problems.

Here are few problems and solutions using Stacks and Queues.
